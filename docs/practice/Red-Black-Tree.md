# Red-Black Tree

A Red-Black Tree is a special kind of tree that helps quickly find, add, and remove data.  
It colors its "nodes" in red or black and follows certain rules to stay balanced and not get messy.

### In simple terms, here are the main rules of a Red-Black Tree:

1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root of the tree is always black.
3. A red node cannot have a red child.
4. Every path from any node to a leaf has the same number of black nodes.
